My passion for harnessing data to drive real-world solutions has led me to play a pivotal role in a groundbreaking project that revolutionized the way individuals and businesses handle their tyre replacement needs.

By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, I have developed a sophisticated platform that not only simplifies the process of scheduling tire replacements online but also enhances the overall customer experience. This platform has redefined the industry by providing users with personalized recommendations, accurate estimates, and convenient booking options.

My work in this project involved the extraction and analysis of massive datasets related to tire specifications, availability, user preferences, and geographic factors. By identifying patterns and optimizing algorithms, I have created a system that ensures timely and cost-effective tire replacements, all while minimizing inconveniences to the end user.

The impact of this project has been truly transformative.

109243,False,"AI driven weapons alarmist, synthetic biological weapon, cyber weapon, nuclear weapon, black swan weapon alarmist! WWIII alarmist! Wealth-and-power inequality alarmist! 

I believe that the *relative* peace we have experienced throughout the world in recent decades (excluding third world), as well as general trends in war, peace, and distribution of wealth, can be explained in large part by trends in military technology. I believe the prevalence of democracy throughout the historical record can be explained in large part by the effectiveness of mass infantry tactics (e.g. the Greek phalanx, Roman legion, the age of muskets) as opposed to elite, wealthy professional soldier tactics (Bronze Age chariots, medieval knights and samurai, cavalries in general).

In particular, I think the current so called ""Pax Americana"" can be explained primarily by the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction, which is that a nuclear first strike would either cause global nuclear winter, or fail to prevent nuclear retaliation, leading to nuclear winter (not to mention the loss of an arbitrary number of major cities and the human lives therein). The reign of this particular strategic balance explains the unprecedented end of frequent wars between global super powers, and even peace among regional powers such as India/Pakistan, and perhaps even the relative reduction in hostility between Israel and North Korea and their neighbors.

In light of this, any technological developments that alter the strategic balance described as mutually assured destruction should invite the immediate and catastrophic resumption of conventional warfare.

Examples:

1) Anything that increases the chance of a successful first strike, meaning a surprise (or not) nuclear attack that does not carry risk of retaliation, global catastrophe, or other undesireable result. Hiroshima/Nagasaki were the first and so far only successful first strike.

2) The rise of systems that can reliably intercept ICBMs, and/or negate other delivery methods of nuclear weapons, to such an extent that nuclear weapons become an obsolete threat.

3) AI. AI soldiers, builders of soldiers, and planners of war have no fear of nuclear annihilation, and would barely be inconvenienced by nuclear winter. 

One of my predicted highly likely scenarios for future war is as follows:

1) AI armies capable of 
eliminating targets (this nearly 
exists e.g. in form of US drone 
arsenal), gathering resources, 
building and maintaining 
factories for new soldiers, 
becomes possible. These may be 
fully autonomous, directly 
controlled by human engineers, 
or anything in between.
    
2) Someone (country, 
corporation, Tony Stark) has 
access to such technology, and 
the capability to develop and 
prepare to implement it in 
secret - at least for long 
enough to make successful 
surprise attack possible.
    
3) This someone has 
incentive to wage war. This can 
obviously take many forms, but 
in particular, I believe an 
increase (or even an anticipated 
increase) in technological rate 
of advancement in various fields 
would provide such an incentive. 

That's because the existing global arms race could become much more fast paced, intensified, and volatile. Not only this, but the initial strategic advantages granted by technological breakthroughs could become greater than ever before, which exacerbates the danger of surprise attack and provides further incentive to conduct R&D.

If nothing else, everyone who values survival will be incentivized to join the arms race by the threat of known or unknown enemies and their potential capabilities. So to be clear, the crux of my arguments have little to do with human nature per se, but more with the rules of game theory and the strategic situation in the world today.","The user's bio presents a detailed and complex analysis of military technology, warfare, and geopolitical dynamics.

### How to pronounce my name (Michał):

Most of my English speaking colleagues when we talk for the first time start by calling me Michael or Michele, it is a little different in Polish:
https://translate.google.pl/?sl=pl&tl=en&text=Micha%C5%82%20Dubrawski&op=translate (like saying ""Me How"" in English as one word)

###CONTACT

Please contact me by email (I have an account on gmail - the address is almost the same as my Metaculus username, but you need to replace ""_"" with ""."". You can also contact me on discord - I am an active member of Metaculus Discord (Michał) 

You can give me anonymous feedback [here](https://www.admonymous.co/michal_dubrawski)

Always look for the Outside View :)

###My projects related to forecasting:

I am an active aggregator of resources about forecasting. 

Here is my Spotify list of Podcasts episodes about forecasting:
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4LKES4QcFNozmwImjHWrBX?

I also have my youtube list of videos related to forecasting: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnUdbSv_SNUu--30vjEDQC5d26-12s0DC

I constantly update these two lists - the new videos and resources are added at the end of each list.

Other forecasting related projects I work on with the help of awesome people from Metaculus and GJOpen community:

- Forecasters reading list (where I list books that in my opinion are relevant for forecasters)
- Metaculus Questions Development Guide
- Framework for forecast Rationale Writing
- List of ideas of how to improve Metaculus Comment System
- Mapping and standardizing probability expressions for my forecast to be consistent when I use words to express probability or confidence (I try to always use numbers anyway in the brackets, but I also feel a need to use words).

###Quotes:

I am a huge fan of Star Trek. Some quotes from the show which I find relevant to forecasting work:
 
""Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end."" 

Spock

""Things are only impossible until they're not."" 

Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Initial Occurrence Syndrome is apparently well known in the XXIV Century)

""Insufficient facts always invite danger.""

* [bet with ThirdEyeOpen](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3142/by-2030-how-many-people-will-have-ever-landed-on-the-moon/#comment-62046) that less than 70 people will have ever walked on the moon by 2030-01-01.  i lose $100 (2021USD) if there are 70 or more, i win $25 if there are fewer.","The user's bio indicates that they are open to real money bets and encourages others to contact them for offers. This suggests a focus on gambling or betting, which can be a red flag for spam, especially when combined with the mention of contacting them via email or Discord. However, the email provided is a Metaculus domain, which implies that the user is likely affiliated with the platform. 

While the language used in the bio does hint at a potential for spam-like behavior (i.e., soliciting bets), it does not explicitly promote a product or service in a spammy manner. The user is discussing predictions and bets in a context that aligns with the purpose of Metaculus.

Given these considerations, the user does not appear to be a spammer or bot, as they are engaging in a relevant discussion about predictions and betting without overtly selling something.

The bio reflects a personal journey and interests, mentioning quitting high school and jobs to pursue different passions, which is typical for a young adult. The language used is casual and expresses curiosity, which is also normal for a user engaging in a community like Metaculus.

Additionally, the user has provided a link to their Twitter account, which suggests they are a real person who is active on social media. There are no indications of spammy language or attempts to sell something in the bio.

The bio indicates that they are a data scientist interested in forecasting, which aligns with the purpose of Metaculus. Additionally, the presence of a personal website further supports the idea that this user is genuine and not trying to sell something or engage in spammy behavior.

I have not been making forecasts on new questions or updating my previous forecasts much, mostly due to a combination time, energy, and interest being in low supply. This aforementioned state of Metaculus engagement started roughly around March 2024.","The user's email is a standard Gmail address, which is common and does not raise any immediate red flags. However, the bio contains a suspiciously formatted email address that seems to be obfuscated, which is often a tactic used by spammers to avoid detection. The user also mentions a lack of engagement with the platform, which could be a sign of a bot or a spammer trying to create a profile without genuine interest in the community.

The combination of the obfuscated email and the lack of meaningful engagement suggests that this user may not be a legitimate participant in the Metaculus community. Therefore, the overall impression leans towards spam.
