The gray lines along the diagonal (y=x) are what you would get by forecasting the \"true\" probability on a large number of questions. The shaded area is the 90% credible interval around the perfect calibration, the width of which depends on how many predictions the forecaster has made in that x-axis range. If the forecaster had been perfectly calibrated, the diamond would have been in that range 90% of the time.",
  "calibrationCurveInfo": "The closer a diamond is to the grey line, the better calibrated the predictions in that probability range. If a diamond is closer to y=50% than the grey bar, that suggests the forecaster is overconfident.",
