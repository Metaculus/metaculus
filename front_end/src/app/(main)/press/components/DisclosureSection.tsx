              Forecasting is the practice of putting explicit probabilities,
              dates, and numbers on future events—calculating odds via both
              models and human judgment.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 mt-0">
              Although such estimates are subjective, a substantial body of
              scientific research demonstrates two points: that people who
              forecast can improve, with some becoming expertly calibrated; and
              that aggregating across many diverse opinions produces more
              accurate forecasts than even the best individuals forecasting
              alone. The resulting predictions give us a clearer sense of what
              tomorrow will look like, allowing us to make better decisions
              today, just as a good meteorologist can help us decide whether to
              carry an umbrella.

              Of course, subjects like geopolitics are not like meteorology.
              Yet, the scientific validity of human forecasting holds true even
              when it comes to subjects with a high degree of uncertainty, like
              the war between Russia and Ukraine. In fact,{" "}

              Because forecasts are expressed probabilistically, we can rarely
              say that a particular forecast was “right” or “wrong,”. Rather, we
              score forecasts mathematically by comparing forecasts to outcomes
              over a large body of questions. This enables us to determine how
              “well-calibrated” any given forecaster is—i.e., do things that
              they believe are 70% likely actually happen 70% of the time-as

              No, Metaculus is a forecasting platform and aggregation engine.
              Like prediction markets, we collect people&apos;s forecasts and
              reward them for accuracy. But in prediction markets, participants
              place bets against each other for financial rewards, can only win
              insofar as someone else loses. Metaculus forecasters are
              incentivized only to make the most accurate forecasts, and they
              often collaborate to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prediction markets produce forecasts via where the betting market
              settles. Metaculus explicitly aggregates everyone&apos;s forecasts
              together using algorithms we refine over time. We produce a
              time-weighted median, the &quot;Community Prediction,&quot; as
