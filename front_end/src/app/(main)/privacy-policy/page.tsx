        1. Registration and Other Information You Provide
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Service may collect information that identifies, relates to,
        describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with,
        or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular
        consumer, household, or device (&quot;
        <strong>Personal Information</strong>
        &quot;). In particular, the Service may collect Personal Information

        accessing your account) and demographic or other information such as

        Some part of the Service may allow you to use the Service to offer your

        internet search providers when someone searches for your name. Metaculus
        does not control how frequently third-party search engines update their

          <strong>Device Identifier</strong> is a number that is automatically

          with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to
          access a Service.

        <li>
          Details of your visits to the Service, including traffic data,

          Service, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led

          Usage Information. Like the information you enter at registration or
          in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your

          cookies as you interact with the Service as explained further in
          Third-Party Content, Links to Other Sites, and Metaculus Content Found

          <p className="mt-2">
            One type of cookie we use, known as a &quot;persistent&quot; cookie,
            is set once you&apos;ve logged in to your account on the Service. If
            you do not log out of your account, then the next time you visit,
            the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing
            user so you will not need to log in before using the Service. Of
            course, if you are using a public computer or sharing your private
            computer with others, you should log out of your account after each
            visit. If you log out of a Service, you will need to re-enter your
            password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account.
            You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided
            in your Internet browser&apos;s &quot;help&quot; file. We also use a
            cookie which functions as a &quot;session&quot; cookie, meaning that
            it is used to identify a particular visit. Session cookies expire
            after a short time or when you close your web browser.

        <strong>Web Beacons or Tracking Pixels:</strong> We, as well as

        DATA SECURITY

      <p className="mb-4">
        Metaculus takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect

        it. We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal
        Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use,
        alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored
        on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be
        encrypted using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. For example, when
        you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number and CCV2
        number on our checkout forms, that information is encrypted using SSL
        technology, to help protect the communications between you and our

        The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where

        California Residents - Your CA Privacy Rights
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the
        State of California have the right to request from companies conducting
        business in California a list of all third parties to which the company
        has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the
        preceding year for the third parties&apos; direct marketing purposes and
        the categories of personal information the company shares.
        Alternatively, the law provides that a company that has a privacy policy
        that provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing
        personal information with third parties for those third parties&apos;
        direct marketing purposes may instead provide information on how to
        exercise that choice. Metaculus qualifies for the alternative option; it
        has a comprehensive privacy policy that sets forth that Metaculus
        provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with
        third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in
        or if you choose to opt-out at the time Metaculus offers that choice,
        Metaculus does not share your information with that identified third
        party for its direct marketing purposes.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you are a California resident and you have questions about our
        practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for
        their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice,
        please send your request to the following email address:{" "}
        <a href="mailto:legal@metaculus.com">legal@metaculus.com</a> or write to
        us at the following mailing address: Metaculus, Inc., 1112 Montana

        &quot;Your California Privacy Rights&quot; in the subject field of your

        designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address,
