        As explained in our privacy policy located at{" "}

        (the &quot;<b>Policy</b>&quot;), which informs you about the categories
        of personal data we collect when you visit the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.metaculus.com">https://www.metaculus.com</a> (the
        &quot;
        <b>Website</b>&quot;), or otherwise interact at all with Metaculus
        (collectively with the Website, the &quot;<b>Services</b>&quot;); our
        practices for collecting, using, retaining, and protecting your personal
        data; and your rights to ensure proper management of this information.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        In the event of a conflict between the terms of this addendum and the
        rest of the Privacy Policy, this addendum shall take precedence for
        residents of the EEA or UK. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall
        have the meanings set forth in the GDPR.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        For our users located in the EEA and the UK, we must have a valid legal
        basis in order to process your personal data. Generally speaking, the
        main legal bases under the GDPR that justify our collection and use of
        your personal data are:
      </p>

      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>
          <b>Performance of a contract:</b> When your personal data is necessary
          to enter into or perform our contract with you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Consent:</b> When you have consented to our use of your personal
          data via a consent form (online or offline).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Legal obligation:</b> When we need to use your personal data to
          comply with our legal obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Legal claims:</b> When your personal data is necessary for us to
          defend, prosecute or make a claim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Legitimate interests:</b> When we use your personal data to achieve
          a legitimate interest and our reasons for using it outweigh any
          prejudice to your data protection rights. For instance, our processing
          of your personal data in connection with our Services is within our
          legitimate interests because the nature of the information (while
          still personal data) is widely available and distributed across the
          internet and otherwise. These interests include, but are not limited
          to, providing our Services and Website; facilitating research, service
          delivery and maintenance; user authentication and account management;
          managing and improving Metaculus operations; security monitoring and
          enforcement; providing technical support; engaging the broader
          community; and promoting Metaculus events and initiatives. If we rely
          on our (or another person&apos;s) legitimate interests for using your
          personal data, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our
          (or the other person&apos;s) legitimate interests are not outweighed
          by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require
          protection of the personal data. You can ask us for information on
          this balancing test by contacting us at{" "}

        purpose of analyzing user behavior (e.g., cookies or device
        fingerprinting). The information collected by Google about the use of
        the Website is usually transferred to a Google server in the United
        States and stored there.
