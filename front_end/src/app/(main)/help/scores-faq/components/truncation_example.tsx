        Alex wants to predict if they will be fired this year. They have a
        performance review scheduled this week. They estimate there is a{" "}
        <MathJaxContent content={`\\(20\\%\\)`} /> chance they fail it, and if
        so they will be fired on the spot. If they don’t fail this week, there
        is still a <MathJaxContent content={`\\(5\\%\\)`} /> chance they will be
        fired at the end of the year. A proper scoring rule ensures that the
        best strategy on this question is to predict{" "}
        <MathJaxContent content={`\\(p=(20\\%+80\\% \\times 5\\%)=24\\%\\)`} />{" "}
        this week, and then <MathJaxContent content={`\\(5\\%\\)`} /> for the
        other 51 weeks (if they weren’t fired).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Without truncation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Without truncation, this honest strategy gives Baseline scores of:</p>

          in the{" "}

          cases they are not fired.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For an average score of{" "}

        But the strategy of “predicting close to 100% in the beginning and lower
        later”, let&apos;s say 99% today, then 5% the other 6 days, without
        truncation gives Baseline scores of:
      </p>
      <ul className="ml-5 list-disc">
        <li>
          <MathJaxContent content={`\\(S(99\\%) \\approx +99\\)`} /> in the{" "}
          <MathJaxContent content={`\\(20\\%\\)`} /> of cases they are fired

      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that <MathJaxContent content={`\\(+68 > +36\\)`} />, so without
        truncation, the gaming strategy gives you a score almost twice as high
        in expectation! It is really not proper.

      <p>
        This time, <MathJaxContent content={`\\(+56 > +48\\)`} />, so with
