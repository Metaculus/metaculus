        to get started for all those who are interested in engaging with the

        We greatly value the contributions of our diverse community of
        forecasters, question authors, and forum participants, and we hope that
        these guidelines will promote, enhance, and safeguard a vibrant
        community forecasting space for many years to come.

        Content that does not adhere to our Moderation Rules will be removed,

      <h2 className="mb-4 mt-8 scroll-mt-nav text-2xl font-bold" id="etiquette">
        Etiquette
      </h2>
      <ol className="list-inside list-decimal space-y-2">
        <li>
          Aim for high-quality, useful and informative content. It&apos;s
          greatly appreciated when participants contribute to the discussion at
          hand. Disruptive comments, derailing, or spam aren&apos;t welcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be respectful of all participants and moderators. Moderators are
          volunteers whose job is to ensure that the platform runs smoothly –
          show them you appreciate their service by giving them the benefit of
          the doubt if you have a misunderstanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep things civil. Offensive or insulting remarks aren&apos;t welcome.
        </li>

        <li>
          Don&apos;t fuel conflicts if they occur. Just disengage and report
          issues using the &quot;Flag&quot; feature on comments if you encounter
          content that violates these guidelines.
        </li>

        <li>
          Be constructive. It&apos;s okay to disagree with others, just keep the
          dialogue positive and respectful.
        </li>

        <li>
          Avoid excessive editorializing. Metaculus is ultimately a place where
          forecasts and individual track records speak for themselves. As a
          general rule, we encourage comments that are on topic, and free from
          personal grievances or strong politics.
        </li>

        <li>
          Show your appreciation. If you think something contributes to
          conversation, upvote it!
        </li>

        <li>
          Search first. If you have questions about how Metaculus works, check
          to see if you can find the answer in the FAQ. There are lots of
          technical details for those interested.
        </li>

        <li>
          Aim for good grammar and spelling. While perfection is certainly not
          the goal, we appreciate linguistic propriety and enjoy the fact that
          you are more likely than not to encounter complete, legible sentences
          here. Please mind your language.
        </li>
        <li>
          Report potential conflicts of interest. At times, forecasters weigh in
          on question resolution discussions. If you do so, it’s considered good
          form to indicate when you have a potential conflict of interest. A
          simple “I will win X points if this question resolves as I suggest it
          should” will suffice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plagiarism is not tolerated. Quoting or citing other sources is very
          welcome when you give attribution to the original source. Trying to
          claim their work as your own is not acceptable.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Moderation Rules
      </h2>
      <ol className="list-inside list-decimal space-y-2">
        <li>
          Do not engage in abusive behaviour. Abusive behaviour includes
          personal attacks, making threats, and harassment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not post or link to any inappropriate, offensive or illegal
          material. Please refrain from posting content that is blatantly
          disruptive to the discussion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not be intolerant of others. Intolerance of a person’s race,
          culture, appearance, gender, sexual preference, religion or age is
          unacceptable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skip advertisements and spam. Linking to relevant resources is fine,
          but promoting products and commercial offerings is not.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don&apos;t impersonate others. If a user claims to be someone they are
          not in comments or in their username, Moderators may ask the user to
          provide identifying information, and remove the misrepresentation if
          the user cannot verify their identity.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you’ve found something wrong, please don’t jeopardize platform
          functionality. We’re constantly working on the Metaculus platform. If
          you have found a bug or if something isn’t working right, we
          appreciate you letting us know via the Contact link in the footer.
