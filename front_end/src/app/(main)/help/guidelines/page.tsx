        Etiquette
      </h2>
      <ol className="list-inside list-decimal space-y-2">
        <li>
          Aim for high-quality, useful and informative content. It&apos;s
          greatly appreciated when participants contribute to the discussion at
          hand with new information or detailed explanations of their reasoning.
          Low-effort comments, derailing, or spam aren&apos;t welcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be respectful of all participants. Give others the benefit of the
          doubt if you have a misunderstanding. Moderators and Admins are trying
          their best to ensure that the platform runs smoothly, keep that in
          mind and engage respectfully.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep things civil. Offensive or insulting remarks aren&apos;t welcome.
        </li>

        <li>
          Don&apos;t fuel conflicts if they occur. Just disengage and report
          issues using the &quot;Report&quot; feature on comments if you
          encounter content that violates these guidelines.
        </li>

        <li>
          Be constructive. It&apos;s okay to disagree with others, just keep the
          dialogue positive and respectful.
        </li>

        <li>
          Avoid excessive editorializing. Metaculus is ultimately a place where
          forecasts and individual track records speak for themselves. As a
          general rule, we encourage comments that are on topic, and free from
          personal grievances or strong politics.
        </li>

        <li>
          Show your appreciation. If you think something contributes to
          conversation, upvote it!
        </li>

        <li>
          Search first. If you have questions about how Metaculus works, check
          to see if you can find the answer in the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/faq/" target="_blank">
            FAQ
          </a>
          . There are lots of technical details for those interested.
        </li>

        <li>
          Aim for good grammar and spelling. While perfection is certainly not
          the goal, we appreciate linguistic propriety and enjoy the fact that
          you are more likely than not to encounter complete, legible sentences
          here. Please mind your language.
        </li>
        <li>
          Report potential conflicts of interest. At times, forecasters weigh in
          on question resolution discussions. If you do so, it’s considered good
          form to indicate when you have a potential conflict of interest. A
          simple “My score will benefit if this question resolves as I suggest
          it should” will suffice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plagiarism is not tolerated. Quoting or citing other sources is very
          welcome when you give attribution to the original source. Trying to
          claim their work as your own is not acceptable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid pasting raw AI output. You can use AI tools to aid your
          forecasts, but focus on the insights that explain your reasoning,
          whether yours or an AI’s, and share them in a way that&apos;s useful
          to others. If some of your reasoning comes from an AI, a best practice
          is to call out what part and mention what model you used.

        Moderation Rules
      </h2>
      <ol className="list-inside list-decimal space-y-2">
        <li>
          Do not engage in abusive behaviour. Abusive behaviour includes
          personal attacks, making threats, and harassment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not post or link to any inappropriate, offensive or illegal
          material. Please refrain from posting content that is blatantly
          disruptive to the discussion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not be intolerant of others. Intolerance of a person’s race,
          culture, appearance, gender, sexual preference, religion or age is
          unacceptable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skip advertisements and spam. Linking to relevant resources is fine,
          but promoting products and commercial offerings is not.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don&apos;t impersonate others. If a user claims to be someone they are
          not in comments or in their username, Moderators may ask the user to
          provide identifying information, and remove the misrepresentation if
          the user cannot verify their identity.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you’ve found something wrong, please don’t jeopardize platform
          functionality. We’re constantly working on the Metaculus platform. If
          you have found a bug or if something isn’t working right, we
          appreciate you letting us know via the Contact link in the footer.
