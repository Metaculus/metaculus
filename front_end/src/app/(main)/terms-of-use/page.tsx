        account, and you may not share your account or any of the Service with
        others. A parent or guardian may create an account for the benefit of a

        expressly authorized by Metaculus. All information you provide to create
        an account must be accurate and complete. You may not impersonate any
        other person or use a name that is not your own. It is your
        responsibility to update your account information to keep it current and

        You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
        password, and for any and all use of your account. You agree not to use

        Legal Disputes
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If a dispute arises between you and Metaculus, you agree that we will
        resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that relates to or
        arises out of the Terms of Use or the Service or your use of the Service
        (a &quot;<strong>Claim</strong>&quot;) in accordance with the
        subsections below.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        General. You and Metaculus agree that any dispute, claim or controversy
        arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach,
        termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof
        (collectively, &quot;<strong>Disputes</strong>&quot;) will be settled by
        binding arbitration; except as set forth in the Judicial Resolution
        section below.{" "}
        <strong>
          You acknowledge and agree that you and Metaculus are each waiving the
          right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class
          member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
        </strong>{" "}
        Further, unless both you and Metaculus otherwise agree, the arbitrator
        may not consolidate more than one person&apos;s claims, and may not
        otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
        proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the
        entirety of this &quot;Legal Disputes&quot; section will be deemed void.
        This &quot;Legal Disputes&quot; section will survive any termination of
        these Terms of Use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves
        the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of
        competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual
        or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a
        party&apos;s intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of
        the User Content and Activities provisions of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Arbitration Rules, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. The
        arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association
        (&quot;<strong>AAA</strong>&quot;) in accordance with the Commercial
        Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
        Disputes (the &quot;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&quot;) then in effect,
        except as modified by this Section of these Terms of Use. (The AAA Rules
        are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at
        1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
        interpretation and enforcement of this Section. These Terms and any
        action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of
        California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The
        exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action taken in a small claims
        court as contemplated by these terms will be the courts located in the
        Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives
        any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must
        provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as
        specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for
        Arbitration at www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477 and a separate form for
        California residents at www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485.) The arbitrator will
        be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the
        state of California and will be selected by the parties from the
        AAA&apos;s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are
        unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of
        the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in
        accordance with the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Metaculus otherwise
        agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
        If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be
        conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Metaculus submit to
        the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator
        determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000,
        your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to
        the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a
        reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the
        expedited nature of the arbitration.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Arbitrator&apos;s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within
        the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&apos;s
        decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which
        the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be
        entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&apos;s
        award damages must be consistent with the terms of Limitation of
        Liability section of these Terms of Use as to the types and the amounts
        of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may
        award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and
        only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
        claimant&apos;s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will
        be entitled to an award of attorneys&apos; fees and expenses, to the
        extent provided under applicable law. Metaculus will not seek, and
        hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover,
        attorneys&apos; fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and
        arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However,
        if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Metaculus will pay
        all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of
        your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was
        frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
        standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

      <p className="mb-4">
        Judicial Resolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) either party
        retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court;
        (2) either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction or other
        appropriate tribunal to secure preliminary or provisional relief as
        available under applicable law in connection with a Dispute; and (3) any
        Dispute involving or relating to (i) the ownership, infringement, or
        misappropriation of any intellectual property right, including but not
        limited to copyrights, patents, patent disclosures and inventions
        (whether patentable or not), trademarks, service marks, trade secrets,
        know-how, and other confidential information, trade dress, trade names,
        logos, corporate names and domain names, together with all of the
        goodwill associated therewith, or (ii) your breach of the License to Use
        Site Content or the Acceptable Use Policy sections set forth above, may
        be brought in the courts of the State of California or the courts of the
        United States of America, in either case, situated in Santa Clara
        County, California. Each party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of
        such courts and waives any defense to the exercise of such jurisdiction
        based on lack of personal jurisdiction or forum non conveniens.{" "}
