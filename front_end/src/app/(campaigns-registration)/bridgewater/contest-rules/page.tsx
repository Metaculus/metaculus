            <b>Description of Tournament.</b> The Tournament, run by Metaculus,
            Inc. (`&quot;Metaculus`&quot;), will test participants&apos; ability
            to make probabilistic forecasts on questions concerning future
            events across a variety of question types (binary, continuous,
            multiple choice, and conditional). Bridgewater Associates, LP
            (`&quot;Bridgewater`&quot;) may reach out to participants who
            perform well in the Tournament to gauge their interest in beginning
            a recruitment process for employment with Bridgewater. By entering
            and participating for the duration of the Tournament, you consent to
            Metaculus sharing your registration and performance information,
            including all personal information (which is information that can be
            used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as your name
            and email address) (`&quot;Personal Information`&quot;), with
            Bridgewater, and consent to Bridgewater contacting you via email
            following the competition regarding potential employment
            opportunities with Bridgewater.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>How to Enter and Participate.</b> Any person wishing to
            participate must create a free Metaculus user account, if they do
            not already have one, and register for the tournament via the
            Tournament landing page, thereby accepting Tournament terms and
            conditions. To make forecasts in this Tournament, visit the relevant
            forecasting question pages on Metaculus and submit your own
            probabilistic forecasts. To qualify for any of the prizes, you need
            to achieve a sufficiently high Peer Score, as assessed by
            Metaculus&apos; Tournament Scoring Rules. Note that you may update
            your forecasts as frequently as you want. No purchase or payment is
            necessary to enter or win. You may enter only once. Entering more
            than once will void all entries and result in disqualification. You
            may not enter more times than indicated by using multiple email
            addresses, identities, or devices in an attempt to circumvent the
            rules. Participants are not allowed to share accounts – forecasts
            must be your own work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Eligibility.</b> Participants must be 18 years of age or older as
            of February 3, 2025. Employees of Metaculus and Bridgewater and
            their affiliates, subsidiaries, and agencies, and members of their
            immediate family or persons living in the same household are not
            eligible to participate. In compliance with U.S. laws and
            regulations, we cannot send monetary prizes, cash equivalents, or
            physical prizes to individuals located in countries subject to U.S.
            sanctions or export restrictions, including but not limited to
            Russia, Cuba, North Korea, and others as determined by current
            regulations. Void where prohibited. Void where prohibited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Timing.</b> The Tournament webpage will be made available on
            January 3, 2025. Practice questions will be available from January
            13, 2025 or earlier to February 3, 2025. Official scored forecasting
            begins February 3, 2025, with additional questions posted February
            10, 2025 and February 17, 2025. Final rankings will be determined
            and winners announced in early April.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Prizes.</b> The Tournament will have a total prize pool of
            $25,000, which will be awarded to a number of participants based on
            their performance in the Tournament. The top 125 forecasters in the
            open category and 125 forecasters in the undergraduate category will
            be eligible for prizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Allocation of Prizes.</b> Allocation of prizes will be determined
            according to Metaculus&apos; Tournament Scoring Rules. Winners will
            receive payouts that depend on their rank and forecasting
            performance, according to their score. A total of $25,000 will be
            awarded across a maximum of 250 prize disbursements. Payouts may be
            paid in the form of cash or a cash equivalent, which may include but
            is not limited to prepaid virtual cards, gift cards, or similar
            methods, at the discretion of Metaculus. Metaculus reserves the
            right to determine the specific form of payment, and no alternative
            form of payment will be offered unless explicitly provided by
            Metaculus. Participants will be scored using Metaculus Tournament
            Scoring Rules. The details of these scoring rules are mathematical
            (you may view the details here), but there are three key features:
            <ul className="ml-6 mt-4 list-inside list-disc space-y-4">
              <li>
                You should expect to receive the highest score if you report
                your true beliefs. For continuous questions, this means that you
                should put the center of your distribution so that your
                probability of the true number falling outside of your reported
                confidence intervals actually reflects how confident you are.
              </li>
              <li>
                The scoring rules reward forecasters for being more accurate
                than the rest of the participants (Peer Score). This means
                it&apos;s worth doing equally a good job on questions that are
                difficult as it is for those which are relatively easy, as
                although your absolute accuracy might be worse for the former,
                you can still increase your score by beating the crowd.
              </li>
              <li>
                The score you are awarded is time-averaged over the time for
                which the question is open, such that the score you earn depends
                upon your predictions&apos; accuracy and when they are made.
                This means both that you should make your first prediction
                early, so as to be rewarded over more of the question&apos;s
                lifetime, and also that you should update your prediction
                anytime new information comes to light that alters your best
                estimate of the probability.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="ml-6 mt-4">
              Metaculus will decide the final resolution of all questions at its
              sole and absolute discretion. Ambiguous or annulled question
              resolutions will be avoided to the maximum extent possible, but in
              the rare instances where they occur, those questions will no
              longer be scored as part of the tournament. Prize recipients will
              be required to verify their identity. Taxes and fees are paid by
              recipients.

            any unforeseen problem—technical, legal or otherwise—prevents the
            Tournament from running as planned.

              What are the rules for competitions on Metaculus?
            </li>
            <p className="ml-6">
              Competitions are run according to rules that describe
              participation guidelines, the criteria used to select a winner of
              the Competition as posted on Metaculus&apos; Web Site. The
              prize(s) awarded to such winner(s), and when such prize(s) will be
              awarded will be posted on our Site. Such rules and selection
              criteria must comply with all applicable laws and these Terms
              (collectively, `&quot;Competition Rules`&quot;). Such Competition
              Rules will also include how and when a Participant User must
              submit Competition Entries (defined below) and the rights that any
              third party will be granted in such Competition Entry upon
              selecting any such Competition Entry as a winner (`&quot;Winning
              Entry`&quot;). Certain rights granted in the Competition Entries
              and Winning Entries are described in Section 9 (Do I have to grant
              any licenses to Metaculus or to other users?) below. The
              Competition Rules may impose additional restrictions or
              requirements for Competitions.

              Participant User is in violation these Terms or otherwise poses a
              risk to Metaculus, the Service or another user of the Service.

              Entry for the purpose of making that Competition Entry accessible

              Entry for such Competition may be subject to further licensing as
