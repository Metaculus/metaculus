        <p className="mb-6">
          This contest consists of a single set of 50 forecasting questions,
          with two separate competitions and leaderboards that differentiate all
          competitors under the banner of the Open Competition from
          undergraduate competitors within the Undergraduate Competition.

          $25,000 In Prizes

        <p className="mb-6">
          Each of the two competitions and leaderboards features a $12,500 prize
          pool, for a total of $25,000. The top 125 forecasters within each
          competition and leaderboard are eligible to win prizes. Competing
          undergraduate forecasters are eligible to be ranked and receive prizes
          for their performance on both leaderboards. Prizes will be awarded
          after contest completion and following identity verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike last competition, this year there is no $50 minimum prize
          awarded, which means the top performers are likely to receive a larger
          share of the prize pool and there may be less than 125 prizes paid out
          in each category.

          automatically also be included in the Open Competition. This is your
          opportunity to stand out to the Bridgewater recruiting team and
          compete for a share of the $12,500 Undergraduate Prize Pool!

          A Note On Weighting
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This year the tournament will use question weighting for question
          groups. Weâ€™re using weighting to reduce the effect of correlation on
          scores and leaderboard placement. There is likely to be correlation in
          some sets of similar questions, resulting in scores on those questions
          containing less signal than if the questions were uncorrelated. We
          want to assess forecasting skill, including on some sets of correlated
          questions, and weighting allows us to do that while reducing the
          impact of correlation on tournament placement.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Question groups are questions that have multiple questions within
          them. Theyâ€™re different from multiple choice questions because the
          subquestions arenâ€™t mutually exclusive. For this tournament, when we
          use a question group weâ€™re going to weight each subquestion within it
          so that the total weight of the question group sums to 1.0.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For example, if weâ€™re asking what the USD exchange rate will be for a
          number of currencies on a certain date, youâ€™ll provide forecasts for
          each listed option. If there are three options, weâ€™ll set the weight
          for each of them to 33%, so that the total weight sums to ~100%. That
          means the entire group will be weighted equivalently to one
          forecasting question. Above weâ€™ve referred to there being 50 questions
          in the tournament, and weâ€™re using that as shorthand to mean a total
          weight of 50. Some of those 50 will be question groups, where the
          group will be worth one question but be broken up into lower-weighted
          subquestions. You can see the question weight used for each
          subquestion under the three-dot menu by each subquestion, as shown in
          the image below.
