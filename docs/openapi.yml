    <li>Most of the API is (hopefully) self-explanatory. You’ll find all the documentation below.
    <li>If you’re testing the waters or doing a one-off analysis, you can dive right in!
    <li>If you’re building an application that connects to the Metaculus API, you’ll need to authenticate.
    </ol>
    
    <b>How to Authenticate</b>
    
    You can see your current API token (or generate one) at your <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/settings/account/#api-access">settings</a> page, under the header "API Access".
    
    You can then add the token to your requests using the <i>Authorization</i> HTTP header. The token should be prefixed by the string literal "Token", with whitespace separating the two strings.
    
    Example:
    
    <blockquote>
    Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b
    </blockquote>
    
    Please note that we throttle requests to 1000 requests per hour to prevent abuse.

    <b>How to generate a continuous cdf?</b>
    
    Generating a CDF to predict on a continuous question can be a bit tricky. We only accept predictions in the form of a 201 point
    CDF, represented as a list of floats, so getting scaling right is very important.

    <details>
    <summary>Expand for CDF generation details and examples</summary>

    To start off, let's take an example question: "What will be the temperature (in Celcius) in New York City on January 1st, 3000?"<br>

    If you were to open the question on the website, you would see that the prediction input will have an x-axis that goes from `-40` to `110`.
    You could also find those values in the api by looking at the `"range_min"` and `"range_max"` properties inside `question["scaling"]`.
    If you want to build a cdf, what does that mean to you? It means that you'll need to generate the heights of the cdf at 201 points
    representing locations between -40 and 110. In this case, the first value of the CDF array we are going to build will be the probability
    that the temperature is less than (not equal to) to -40. The last value will represent the probability that the temperature is less 
    than or equal to 110. We then see that the `"zero_point"` in `question["scaling"]` is None, so we can conclude that the remaining
    values in the CDF array represent the height of the cdf at equally spaced locations between -40 and 110. This is because the `"zero_point"`
    being empty means that the question scaling is linear.<br>

    Here's a function that can take in a nominal location and return the corresponding "internal location" x-value. Note that it
    does account for logarithmic scaling.
    ```python
    import datetime
    import numpy as np

    def nominal_location_to_cdf_location(
        nominal_location: str | float,
        question_data: dict,
    ) -> float:
        """Takes a location in nominal format (e.g. 123, "123",
        or datetime in iso format) and scales it to metaculus's
        "internal representation" range [0,1] incorporating question scaling"""
        if question_data["type"] == "date":
            scaled_location = datetime.fromisoformat(nominal_location).timestamp()
        else:
            scaled_location = float(nominal_location)
        # Unscale the value to put it into the range [0,1]
        scaling = question_data["scaling"]
        range_min = scaling.get("range_min")
        range_max = scaling.get("range_max")
        zero_point = scaling.get("zero_point")
        if zero_point is not None:
            # logarithmically scaled question
            deriv_ratio = (range_max - zero_point) / (range_min - zero_point)
            unscaled_location = (
                np.log(
                    (scaled_location - range_min) * (deriv_ratio - 1)
                    + (range_max - range_min)
                )
                - np.log(range_max - range_min)
            ) / np.log(deriv_ratio)
        else:
            # linearly scaled question
            unscaled_location = (scaled_location - range_min) / (range_max - range_min)
        return unscaled_location
    ```

    But you don't want to have to do this manually for every point in a 201 point CDF, so instead let's do it with percentiles.
    Let's say that we have a solid idea about what our 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles are in real units. We can use those to
    generate a CDF. But, note that if our 5th and 95th percentiles don't overlap the range of the question, we'll have to add a few
    more bits of information to complete our CDF.<br>

    Here's a function that can take in some percentiles and return an inferred linearly interpolated CDF.
    ```python
    def generate_continuous_cdf(
        percentiles: dict,
        question_data: dict,
        below_lower_bound: float = None,
        above_upper_bound: float = None,
    ) -> list[float]:
        """

        Param: percentiles
        dict[str, float | str]

          interpretable as a float (for "numeric" type questions) or a datetime in
          ISO format (for "date" type questions)
        example percentiles:
        percentiles = {
          "percentile_01": 25,
          "precentile_25.123": 500,
          "50": 650,
          "percentile_75": "700",
          "percentile_99": 990,
        }
        optionally, include `below_lower_bound` and `above_upper_bound`
        to indicate the amount of probability mass assigned to those locations
        percentiles = {
          "percentile_25": 500,
          "percentile_50": 650,
          "percentile_75": 700,
        }
        below_lower_bound = 0.0025,
        above_upper_bound = 0.009,

        If the percentile locations don't encompass
          [scaling["range_min"], scaling["range_max"]]
        and "below_lower_bound"/"above_upper_bound" aren't provided,
        then the prediction can't be interpreted as a cdf properly.
        Note that range_min/range_max for date questions are unix timestamps.

    ```

    Phew, that was pretty long, but now we can take a set of nominal percentiles and generate a CDF that is in the format
    that the Metaculus api will accept. But wait! Just because we have a cdf that represents out beliefs, it doesn't 
    mean Metaculus will accept it. We'll have to make sure it obeys a few rules, lest it be rejected as invalid.
    
    1. The cdf must be strictly increasing by at least 0.00005 per step. This is because Metaculus evaluates continuous forecasts
        by their PDF (technically a PMF) dervied as the set of differences between consecutive CDF points, and 0.00005 is the 
        minimum value allowed to avoid scores getting too arbitrarily negative.
    
    2. The cdf must not increase by more than 0.59 at any step, as this is the maximum value attainable via the sliders in the UI.
        This threshold may be lowered in the future.
    
    3. The cdf must obey bounds. If a boundary is open, at least 0.1% of probability mass must be assigned outside of it; if it
        is closed, no probability mass may be outside of it.

    Here's a standardization function that ensures your CDF will be accepted. It does add a linear component to the cdf,
    so those with an abundance of precision in their forecasts way want to skip it. The cdfs (and thus their derived pdfs)
    you see on the website have been standardized in this way.
    ```python
    def standardize_cdf(cdf: list[float], question_data: dict) -> list[float]:
        """
        Takes a cdf and returns a standardized version of it

        - assigns no mass outside of closed bounds (scales accordingly)
        - assigns at least a minimum amount of mass outside of open bounds
        - increasing by at least the minimum amount (0.01 / 200 = 0.0005)

        TODO: add smoothing over cdfs that spike too heavily (exceed a change of 0.59)
        """

        upper_open = question_data["open_upper_bound"]

        scale_lower_to = 0 if lower_open else cdf[0]
        scale_upper_to = 1.0 if upper_open else cdf[-1]
        rescaled_inbound_mass = scale_upper_to - scale_lower_to

        def standardize(F: float, location: float) -> float:
            # `F` is the height of the cdf at `location` (in range [0, 1])
            # rescale
            rescaled_F = (F - scale_lower_to) / rescaled_inbound_mass
            # offset
            if lower_open and upper_open:
                return 0.988 * rescaled_F + 0.01 * location + 0.001
            elif lower_open:
                return 0.989 * rescaled_F + 0.01 * location + 0.001
            elif upper_open:
                return 0.989 * rescaled_F + 0.01 * location
            return 0.99 * rescaled_F + 0.01 * location

        standardized_cdf = []
        for i, F in enumerate(cdf):
            standardized_F = standardize(F, i / (len(cdf) - 1))
            # round to avoid floating point errors
            standardized_cdf.append(round(standardized_F, 10))

        return standardized_cdf
    ```

    With this tiny guide, you can be well along your way to submitting continuous forecasts to Metaculus.

            The CDF is 201 values long, representing the height of the CDF at 201

            the question's scaling. See notes in this section for suggestions on
            generating a cdf.<br><br>

            If a question has a closed lower bound 
            (`question["open_lower_bound"] == False`), the first value of the CDF 
            must be 0.0. Otherwise it must be at least 0.001 - meaning at least 
            0.1% of the probability mass must be assigned below the lower bound.<br><br>

            If a question has a closed upper bound 
            (`question["open_upper_bound"] == False`), the last value of the CDF 
            must be 1.0, otherwise no more than 0.999 - meaning at least 
            0.1% of the probability mass must be assigned above the upper bound.<br><br>

            At least 1% of the probability mass must be assigned uniformly within 
            bounds, which means that the CDF must be strictly increasing by at 
            least 0.01/200 = 0.00005 per step. No two adjacent values of the CDF 
            can differ by more than 0.59, which is the largest number obtainable 
            via the sliders.

      In the updated version of Metaculus, standalone questions no longer exist. Instead, the feed is made up of Post entities, where each post can contain various types of content objects. These include:
      
      - Individual questions
      - Groups of questions
      - Conditional pairs
      - Notebooks
      
      The primary entry point for retrieving feed data and interacting with both Posts and Questions is the `/api/posts` endpoint.

            Order by specific fields. For DESC sorting, add `-` prefix, e.g. `-published_at`.

            **Sorting option descriptions:**
            - `hotness`: Composite score based on post approval time, relevant news, votes, comments, and question metrics (movement, open time, resolution). Uses a decay function where scores decrease over time (posts older than 3.5 days decay with (days/3.5)^-2).
            - `score`: User-specific forecasting performance score. **Requires** `forecaster_id` parameter to be provided.
